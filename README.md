# Loan Default_ redictor

In this project, we aim to develop a robust loan default predictor using logistic regression modeling techniques applied to the "SBA Loans Case Data Set" sourced from Kaggle. Small Business Administration (SBA) loans play a crucial role in fostering entrepreneurship by providing financial assistance to small businesses. However, predicting the likelihood of loan default is pivotal for lenders to manage risk effectively and ensure the stability of their portfolios.

The project will follow a structured approach:

Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: We will start by obtaining the SBA Loans Case Data Set from Kaggle, which contains information about loan applicants, loan characteristics, and loan status (default or non-default). Preprocessing steps will involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Through EDA, we will gain insights into the characteristics of the dataset, explore relationships between variables, and identify potential patterns or trends that may influence loan default. Visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices will be employed to facilitate understanding.

Feature Engineering: We will engineer new features or transform existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model. This may include creating interaction terms, polynomial features, or aggregating information from multiple variables.

Model Training and Evaluation: Logistic regression, a popular classification algorithm, will be employed to build the loan default predictor. The dataset will be split into training and testing sets to assess the model's performance. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC will be utilized to gauge the effectiveness of the model in distinguishing between default and non-default cases.

Hyperparameter Tuning: We will fine-tune the hyperparameters of the logistic regression model using techniques like grid search or randomized search to optimize its performance.

Model Interpretation: Interpretability is crucial in understanding the factors driving loan default. We will analyze the coefficients of the logistic regression model to identify significant features and their impact on the likelihood of default.

Through this project, we aim to develop a reliable loan default predictor that can assist financial institutions and lenders in making informed decisions, mitigating risk, and promoting responsible lending practices in support of small businesses and economic growth.
